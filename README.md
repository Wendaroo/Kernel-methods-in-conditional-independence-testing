# Kernel-methods-in-conditional-independence-testing

This code is associated to the essay I wrote during my part III Mathematics studies at Cambridge University. It runs simulations testing two statistical tests of
conditional independence - KCIT (Kernel Conditional Independence Test) introduced by Zhang et al. (2011), and GCM (Generalised Covariance Measure), introduced by
Shah and Peters (2020).
